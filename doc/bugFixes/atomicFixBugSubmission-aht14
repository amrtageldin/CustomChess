## Description

Atomic Chess does not work as expected

## Expected Behavior

When a piece is captured, the explosion mimics the 'capture' describes the atomic spotCollection
given to that piece, and only immune pieces survive.

## Current Behavior

Currently, in Atomic Chess if you capture a piece, the only thing that happens is that both the piece
you capture and the piece you captured disappear.

## Steps to Reproduce

Provide detailed steps for reproducing the issue.

 1. Set up a game of atomic chess
 2. List the default AtomicCapture as KingMovement
 3. Capture an enemy piece with a piece of your own in the vicinity of other pieces
 4. The nearby pieces that should explode will not

## Failure Logs

N/A

## Hypothesis for Fixing the Bug

Hypothesis 1)
Print the outcome of the atomic capture spots before filtering; it will likely be incorrect
for some reason. Test by testing that it contains the spots / number of spots you would expect it to
have

Hypothesis 2)
Print the outcome of the atomic capture after filtering; check to see that it correctly impacts
the spots you assumed it would (test the number as opposed to the specific spot).
