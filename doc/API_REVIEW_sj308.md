# OOGA API review
###Partner Team: 3, Partner Name: Norah Tan
###My name: Tim Jang, my netID: sj308

We talked about our project's public methods and APIs. I walked through the classes that I worked
on with my partner and showed my partner the public methods. Her feedback was that my APIs 
look good and don't break any encapsulation rules. My partner also walked through her code
and the things she implemented. Since her project also included a checkerboard pattern board
and relatively similar games as chess, there were a lot of public methods that were similar to mine. 
She also talked about the AI she was implementing because she was doing that for the challenge part of the project.
Additionally, we talked about how my public methods could be more encapsulated so 
that the code could be better protected.
