## Project's current progress
In terms of current project, our team feels like we are somewhat on track; we are satisfied with the
work done in our last sprint and where we at. However, we do feel as through there has been somewhat
of a disconnect between the frontend and the backend, and that we need to work to get our project more
cohesive. We should also begin thinking about flexibility and ways to make our code easy to change
