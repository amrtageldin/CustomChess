## Project's current progress
In terms of current project, our team feels like we are somewhat on track; we are satisfied with the
work done in our last sprint and where we at. However, we do feel as through there has been somewhat
of a disconnect between the frontend and the backend, and that we need to work to get our project more
cohesive. We should also begin thinking about flexibility and ways to make our code easy to change

## Current level of communication
We feel pretty satisfied with the level of communication within the backend and between backend and
controller, but the level of communication between the frontend and controller could use some work.

## Satisfaction with team roles
The backend/frontend are relatively happy with their roles; the controller wants more integration into
other parts and will join the backend.

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1
We had effective in person meetings where we sorted out what each person would work on, and we 
were able to accomplish each of our assigned parts of the program individually.
* Thing #2
We have a good track of what needs to be done, and everyone has done their assigned componemnts
in the project.

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1
Front-end communication and split the work more evenly among our teammates. 
* Thing #2
We could be thinking more flexibly, and thinking about and analyzing consequences that may arise
in the future so that we can implement new features without changing a lot of the code.

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint
Front-end communication with the back-end. We also need to make sure each part of the project links with
all the other parts.
