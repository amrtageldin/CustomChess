# OOGA Team Contract

### Team Name: Team Stack Overflow

### 3 November

## As a project team, we promise to:

* respect each other's ideas and work
* communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project
* others based on your team discussion

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:

* have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* report the issue in the Team Sprint Report

## Team Procedures


### Team meetings 
 * when and how often to meet (at least once a week)
 * how to communicate action items made during the meeting
 * policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it
 * policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting

### Communications

* decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)
    * We will make most of our decision by consensus but if necessary and it appears their is an
      impasse, we will opt for a majority vote so that we can continue progressing
* preferred channel of communication (e.g., Zoom, e-mail, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
    * We will primarily use our SMS messages chat for high-speed communication that we know all of
      us are checking relatively frequently
    * We will also use the GroupMe created as necessary, particularly for sharing links and files
      from our computers that we otherwise can't access
        * An example is a CodeWithMe link
* response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours)
    * During daytime hours, team members should aim to respond within 12 hours
    * For messages sent at night, there is more leniency
    * Overall we will keep ourselves accountable and ensure maximum 24 hours notice regardless of
      other circumstances, this allows flexibility for midterms or other projects/events that might
      come up
* policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates
    * we intend to remain in close collaboration and constnatly send messages/updates to our
      communication channels to explain what we have coded/pushed and why we did it, this will
      ensure that we are able to understand what is going on throughout hte project and that we all
      have a good idea of our progress thus far

### Helping each other
 * how and when to ask for help and what is needed to show effort
 * response to team member asking for help
 * ways to "go above and beyond" as needed to support the team and even other teams

### Commitments

* what does it mean to work to the "best of your ability"
    * Work to the best of your ability means to try to learn how to complete accepted tasks. If they
      are beyond you ability seek help and ensure it gets completed while learning what was needed
      along the way.
* how to set internal deadlines
    * If a teamember relys on someone else's code, then compromise on a time that gives both
      teammates enough time to work on the given task. If a group meeting is arranged to work on the
      project as a whole, bring your piece of the code ready to be implemented, so an internal deadline
* how to provide commitments others on the team can rely on
* policy for resolving failure to meet commitments
    * We will meet as a team and collectively discuss the failure of the team member to meet the
      commitments as this is impacting the entire team's progress
    * We think this is the best way to continue working together as a team and keep each other
      accountable
    * If the other team meber isn't willing to change their actions and get their work done, then we
      would have to resort to informing class staff
    * Overall we think we will work together well and that outside intervention will not be
      necessary to manage any conflicts.
