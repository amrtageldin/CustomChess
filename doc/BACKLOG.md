# Backlog
## Use Cases
>  Write at least six Use Cases per team member that describe specific features each person expects to complete â€” these will serve as the project's initial Backlog. Focus on features you plan to complete during the first two Sprints (i.e., the project's highest priority features). Note, they can be similar to those given in the assignment specification, but should include more detail specific to your project's goals. This file is not in the plan folder because, ideally, it should be a living document that is updated throughout the project to add new use cases as they arise.
